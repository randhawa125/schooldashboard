                The year 2020 introduced us to so many changes that it is impossible to go back to square one. The world is rapidly changing the knowledge and skills landscape. With the introduction of the New Education Policy of India, it is evident that there has been a shift in demand across the globe and skills play the most critical role in carving our career. Therefore, to keep up with the changing employment landscape, one needs to be future-ready by not merely accepting the change, but rather winning it.
